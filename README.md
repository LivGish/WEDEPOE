5.	Design and User Experience
Layout and Design
Bar at the top of the screen 
•	logo + company name
•	drop-down menu to switch pages 
•	Shopping cart

Page Layout
•	Wallpaper will be beige (hex code #F2E9D4 as seen in Figure 1) with the remainder of the colours being used for headings, icons and other accent design aspects. This will cause contrast between the background and design aspects, which will make them more eye-catching to the user. 
•	The information used on the Homepage will be organised into sections and subsections based on the content that it contains, which will make the page less overwhelming to the users.

Bar at the bottom of the screen 
•	Contact information
•	Links to social media platforms
•	Hyperlinks to other pages in website

UI Considerations
•	The contrast between the background and the accent colours makes the design aspects such as headings, icons and buttons easier to see, which benefits the general population, but specifically users with vision impairments. 
•	The drop-down menu at the top of the screen, as well as the navigation hyperlinks at the bottom of the page, make the website easy to navigate and understand.
•	The colours being modified from their original shades to make them more uniform gives the website a more professionally crafted feel, which makes it more attractive to users.
