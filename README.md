5.	Design and User Experience
Layout and Design
Bar at the top of the screen 
•	logo + company name
•	drop-down menu to switch pages 
•	Shopping cart

Page Layout
•	Wallpaper will be beige (hex code #F2E9D4 as seen in Figure 1) with the remainder of the colours being used for headings, icons and other accent design aspects. This will cause contrast between the background and design aspects, which will make them more eye-catching to the user. 
•	The information used on the Homepage will be organised into sections and subsections based on the content that it contains, which will make the page less overwhelming to the users.

Bar at the bottom of the screen 
•	Contact information
•	Links to social media platforms
•	Hyperlinks to other pages in website

UI Considerations
•	The contrast between the background and the accent colours makes the design aspects such as headings, icons and buttons easier to see, which benefits the general population, but specifically users with vision impairments. 
•	The drop-down menu at the top of the screen, as well as the navigation hyperlinks at the bottom of the page, make the website easy to navigate and understand.
•	The colours being modified from their original shades to make them more uniform gives the website a more professionally crafted feel, which makes it more attractive to users.

6.	Technical Requirements 
Hosting: GitHub
Domain: LoveMatchaCafe.co.za
The website will be developed on VS Code using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and JS for user interactivity. The code will be shared on GitHub, which will allow others to access the code as well as keep track of commits and edits made to the code as the project progresses.

11. Part 1 feedback reflection
For part 1 of my project, there were a few components identified in which I could have improved upon before my project was submitted, the main one being that a changelog was not added. This was a crucial step missed not only because it allows me to keep track of the progress I have made throughout my project, but it allows others to see how I have progressed through my project and the order in which I carried out my work. 
The changelog for all work previously done was added after receiving feedback from part 1, and it was updated alongside any changes made throughout the process of creating the code for part 2.
Another area that could've been improved on before part 1 was submitted was my grammar. While marks were not deducted for this, I felt as though this lowered the quality of my work. Once I began work for part 2, many gramatical errors were found and corrected, and I will be more cautious with my grammar going forward. 

12. Part 2 feedback reflection
There were multiple places in part 2 where I could have improved the quality of my work, the first being a misunderstanding of how to reflect on feedback from part 1. In part 2, I implimented all corrections to my code without writing a report on them, which would've allowed others to see how I reflected on and corrected any previous errors. 
Reports on feedback reflection were added for both parts 1 and 2 following the release of part 2 feedback.
The website's resposiveness, specifically with typography and images, could've been improved on aswell, such as ensuring that both the images and text shrink down with the window size so that everything stays propotionate. These corrections were carried out following the release of part 2 feedback.
